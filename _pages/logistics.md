### Communication

Discord is intended for all announcements, general questions about the course, clarifications about assignments, student questions to each other, discussions about material, and so on.

---

### Grading

This class requirements include 3 homework assignments (45% of the grade), a final project presentation (50% of the grade) and participation (5% of the grade).  Each assignment takes 15% of the grade.  Every student should work on the assignments individually.  The requirements of the final project include a project proposal presentation (10% of the grade), two mid-term presentation (2*5% of the grade) and a poster presentation (30% of the grade).  Students will earn the credit of participation by attending the poster presentation **in person** at the end of the semester.

#### Late Policy of Homework Assignments

Throughout the whole semester, each student has a maximum of **5 grace days** for late submission.  **After using up the grace days, the score of the assignment will be multiplied by 0.7 for each additional day of delay.**  The submission deadline is based on Taiwan’s time zone

#### Grading policy of final project presentations

The proposal and mid-term presentations will be scored by the instructor and TAs:

$\mathrm{score} = \frac{1}{N+1} \mathrm{score_{tw}} + \frac{1}{N+1} \sum_{i}^{N} \mathrm{score_{TA, i}}$

The poster presentations will be scored by the instructor, TAs and the students:

$\mathrm{score} = \frac{1}{N+2} \mathrm{score_{tw}} + \frac{1}{N+2} \sum_{i}^{N} \mathrm{score_{TA, i}} + \frac{1}{N+2} \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j}^{M} \mathrm{score_{student, j}}$

### Homework Assignments

You are encouraged to discuss with others, but do not share your codes with them!  If you wrote the same code as others, you may waive the penalty by refactoring your code in-person within limited time, or otherwise, you’ll get 15% total grade penalty (for each assignment).

Please list your collaborator in the appendix of each assignment

You are allowed to use AIs at your own risk.  You are responsible for refactoring the code snippets generated by AIs.  You’ll get the penalty as long as your submitted codes are the same as others.

### Final Project Presentations

You can form a team of 3 members.  If you really want to work alone, come and chat with us.

You will submit a proposal, describing the topic, experimental setup, todos and expected contribution of each member for the final project.

All members need to code.  You are encouraged to create a github repo, keeping track the contributions of each member.  If you found piggybackers on your team, come to discuss with us along with your github repo.
